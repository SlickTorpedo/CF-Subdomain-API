You **must** install the following plugins on your Minecraft Server and restart the server.
#
Skript:
https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases

Disky:
https://github.com/DiSkyOrg/DiSky/releases
#
Then put the "bot.sk" file inside /plugins/Skript/scripts file. 
Open it and configure the options at the top.
Make sure intents are enabled on Discord Dev Portal!
#
Then go to console and type ```/sk reload bot```
From then on, if something breaks, you may fix it by typing "-r" in any channel!
#
As long as the server is online, the bot is online!
