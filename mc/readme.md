Then put the "bot.sk" file inside /plugins/Skript/scripts file. 
Open it and configure the options at the top.
Make sure intents are enabled on Discord Dev Portal!
#
Then go to console and type ```/sk reload bot```
From then on, if something breaks, you may fix it by typing "-r" in any channel!
#
As long as the server is online, the bot is online!
#
The commands for the bot are as follows:<br>
-r (Reload Bot)<br>
.sda (Add Subdomain)<br>
.subdomains @user (View persons subdomains)<br>
.subdomain (When private messaged to the bot it sends their subdomains)<br>
